# Measures Converter App

## About Me
Hi! I'm **Abhishek Vishwakarma**, and I've created this Flutter-based measures converter application. This project demonstrates my skills in Flutter development, UI/UX design, and mathematical conversions.

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive unit converter application built with Flutter that allows users to convert between different units of measurement. The app features a modern, intuitive interface with support for both distance and weight conversions.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Distance Conversions**: Convert between meters, feet, kilometers, miles, centimeters, inches, and yards
- **Weight Conversions**: Convert between kilograms, pounds, grams, ounces, and tons
- **Real-time Conversion**: Instant calculation with precise decimal accuracy
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, modern Material Design 3 UI

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Features
- **Gradient Background**: Beautiful indigo gradient for visual appeal
- **Card-based Layout**: Organized sections with elevated cards for better UX
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Color-coded Results**: Green-themed result display for clear feedback

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- **Dynamic Unit Selection**: Automatically updates available units based on category
- **Precise Calculations**: Uses accurate conversion factors for reliable results
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling with setState

## Code Structure

### Main Components

#### 1. **MyApp Widget**
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget
```
- Sets up the MaterialApp with indigo theme
- Configures Material Design 3
- Initializes the main converter screen

#### 2. **ConverterScreen Widget**
```dart
class ConverterScreen extends StatefulWidget
```
- Main screen containing all conversion logic
- Manages state for user inputs and results

#### 3. **Conversion Logic**
The app uses a comprehensive conversion factors map:
```dart
final Map<String, Map<String, double>> _conversionFactors
```
This structure allows for efficient lookups between any two units within the same category.

### Key Methods

#### `_convert()`
- Validates user input
- Performs conversion using lookup tables
- Handles edge cases (same unit conversion, unsupported conversions)
- Updates UI with formatted results

#### `_onUnitTypeChanged()`
- Manages category switching (distance â†” weight)
- Resets unit selections appropriately
- Clears previous results

#### `_getUnits()`
- Returns appropriate unit list based on selected category
- Ensures UI consistency

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (^3.9.0)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android/iOS emulator or physical device

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd semad1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Dependencies

The project uses minimal dependencies for a lightweight, fast application:

- **flutter**: Core Flutter framework
- **cupertino_icons**: ^1.0.8 - iOS-style icons
- **flutter_lints**: ^5.0.0 - Code quality and style enforcement

linux/                 # Linux platform support
```

## Conversion Accuracy

I've implemented precise conversion factors for all supported units:

### Distance Conversions
- **Meters**: Base unit for distance calculations
- **Feet**: 1 meter = 3.28084 feet
- **Kilometers**: 1 meter = 0.001 kilometers
- **Miles**: 1 meter = 0.000621371 miles
- **Centimeters**: 1 meter = 100 centimeters
- **Inches**: 1 meter = 39.3701 inches
- **Yards**: 1 meter = 1.09361 yards

### Weight Conversions
- **Kilograms**: Base unit for weight calculations
- **Pounds**: 1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds
- **Grams**: 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
- **Ounces**: 1 kilogram = 35.274 ounces
- **Tons**: 1 kilogram = 0.00110231 tons

## UI/UX Design Decisions

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Indigo - Professional and trustworthy
- **Background**: Gradient from indigo-50 to white - Subtle and modern
- **Results**: Green theme - Positive feedback for successful conversions

### Layout Strategy
- **Card-based Design**: Each functional section is contained in elevated cards
- **Consistent Spacing**: 20px spacing between major sections
- **Responsive Input Fields**: Proper keyboard types for numerical input
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Bold headers with consistent typography

## Future Enhancements

As the creator, I'm planning to add these features in future versions:

1. **Temperature Conversions**: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
2. **Volume Conversions**: Liters, gallons, cubic meters, etc.
3. **Currency Conversions**: Real-time exchange rates
4. **History Feature**: Save recent conversions
5. **Dark Mode**: Theme switching capability
6. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline functionality
7. **Unit Favorites**: Quick access to frequently used conversions

## Testing

The project includes basic widget testing:
```bash
flutter test
```
